**Before using this study, make sure your account has Advanced Features Enabled.**

This study will show you every trade you made on the stock or option and visually show you your position, automatically. If you pair it with a 200 SMA (like this [here](https://preview.redd.it/hwyby2bf58r61.png?width=1237&format=png&auto=webp&s=57ec1a84d3395d9ebc064bbe9dc8f6a5ca17aa2f)), the P/L and "buy/sell" indicators are even more apparent.

# Detail View _(Advanced Ft. Version)_:   [https://tos.mx/S8raoII](https://tos.mx/S8raoII) #
This study goes under the chart (lower), and works best if used on an option chart, but is adaptive depending on the type of security. This just has extra information on the stock/option if you want to view it. Sometimes it's useful, other times it just gets in the way. It's especially helpful when showing you the break-evens, greeks, and a snapshot of the volume/open int.

# Cost Basis _(Manual Version)_:   [https://tos.mx/77x06I0](https://tos.mx/77x06I0) #
This study is meant for those who dont have Advanced features enabled (default cash/margin accounts)

This study lets you manually enter any open position to be visualized on any chart. This way, you don't have to always switch back to the monitor tab to view your P/L, basis, etc. Also, if you have multiple accounts in other brokers, this study lets you add your other positions (per stock) in thinkorswim - on the chart. On top of that, if, say you made a realized loss on the stock in the past, it will show you what your "adjusted trade price" is, taking into account how many shares you have open.

## Tips ##
"Advanced Features" studies will only work if the account has advanced features enabled (it should be enabled if the account is a forex account). 
In my case, since I have a normal Cash account, I had to call TDA _(800-669-3900)_ and get approved.

Once you import the studies, if you want to change the default settings, edit the study then click "Save as Default" - this will make sure that every time you pull up the study (on any quote), it will start with your default settings.
